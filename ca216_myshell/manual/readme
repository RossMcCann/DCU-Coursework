SYNOPSIS
        myshell [batchfile]

DESCRIPTION
        myshell is a simple command line interface written in C. It is run with the 
        "myshell" command, and if a batchfile is provided with program invocation the 
        shell will run in batchmode, and use the batchfile as stdin. When run in batchmode, 
        the shell will terminate at the batchfile eof. Otherwise, myshell will be run 
        in interactive mode, where stdin will be read from user input.

COMMANDS
        There are eight built-in commands in myshell. All other commands can be run by 
        myshell, but require the program to execute them as a child process. The eight
        built-in commands in myshell are:

                cd
                        Change the current default directory. An argument provided
                        to cd is assumed to be a path to the desired directory.
                clr
                        Clear the screen.
                dir
                        List the contents of a directory. An argument provided to
                        dir is assumed to be a path to the directory to list the 
                        contents of. If no argument is passed, the command will list
                        the contents of the current working directory.
                environ
                        Lists all the environment variables of the myshell program.
                echo
                        Prints the arguments on the display, followed by a newline. Multiple
                        spaces and tabs will be reduced to one singular space.
                help
                        Displays the user manual for myshell.
                pause
                        Pauses operation of the myshell program and waits for the user
                        to press enter before resuming operation.
                quit
                        Exit the myshell program.

I/O REDIRECTION
        The myshell program has the ability to redirect stdin and stdout to specified
        file streams. An example of I/O redirection is:

                programname arg1 arg2 < inputfile > outputfile

        In this example, [programname] will be executed with arguments [arg1] and [arg2].
        The stdin filestream will be replaced by [inputfile], and the stdout filestream
        will be replaced by [outputfile].

        With stdout redirection, the > symbol indicates that stdout will be redirected and
        truncated in [outputfile]. If the redirection symbol is >>, then stdout will be
        redirected and appended to [outputfile].

BACKGROUND EXECUTION
        It is possible for myshell to perform background execution of commands. This has not
        been implemented for the myshell built-in commands, but can be performed on all other
        commands. An ampersand character (&) at the end of the users command line input
        indicates that myshell should execute the command in the background. In doing this,
        myshell will return to the command line prompt immediately, and will continue to run
        the previous program in the background.
